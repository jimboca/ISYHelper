# isyhelper
Program to assist with communication between ISY994 and anything else.

This is a python program to assist with communicating between the [ISY994i Series Controller](https://www.universal-devices.com/residential/isy994i-series) and any other device you can access.

More documentation coming someday...

Currently there is no installation processes, you must download.

- cd ISYHelper
- cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
- Edit config.yaml for your devices
- ./isyhelper.py

**HUGE** Thanks to Automicus (Ryan Kraus) for his https://github.com/automicus/PyISY library which this references.
